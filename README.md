# Converters

This repository contains a collection of conversion scripts for various datasets and code lists to RDF:

* HISCO vocabulary
* Canadian Families data
* NAPP data
* ClioInfra converters

Also:

* Data ingestion scripts for uploading the results of data conversion to Virtuoso
* A parallelized converter for very (very) large datasets.

### TODO

We're in the process of harmonizing these converters to a comprehensive utility package for batch conversion of multiple datasets in various formats (including datasets mapped through the [QBer](https://github.com/CLARIAH/QBer) tool).
