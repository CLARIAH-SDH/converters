### Linked Vocabulary for HISCO

This project provides the Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations as linked data. In addition to definitions and labels for all of the concepts such as 'minor groups' and 'major groups', the index of occupations in the HISCO book (Van Leeuwen, Maas and Miles, 2002) is provided as linked data.

Next updates will include lists of occupations coded into HISCO. We're always looking for new occupations that have been coded into HISCO, so if you have such a set of occupations, please consider of [donating](mailto:richard.zijdeman@iisg.nl) your expertise to this project.

### Still to do
- add status, relation and product codes to occupations in HISCO book
- include the comtxt and provenance fields
